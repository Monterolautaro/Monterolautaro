# 👋 Hi, I'm Tomas Lautaro Montero

## About Me

I’m a full stack developer with hands-on experience building, maintaining, and debugging production systems for both startups and enterprise clients.

My work focuses on transforming complex business processes into scalable, maintainable web platforms — from multi-tenant SaaS products to high-traffic insurance systems. I’m particularly comfortable working close to the business logic, handling edge cases, performance bottlenecks, and production incidents.

I currently work on production systems for a multinational insurance company while also developing full-stack SaaS projects independently.

## What I Do Best

- Designing **multi-role and multi-tenant architectures**
- Building **end-to-end workflows** with complex state transitions
- Debugging **production issues** (containers, processes, memory, logs)
- Writing **clean, explicit backend logic** with strong validations
- Bridging **UX requirements and backend constraints**
- Shipping MVPs fast without sacrificing long-term scalability
